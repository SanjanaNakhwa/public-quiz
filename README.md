# Public Quiz Device

- For users: üèÉ [Setup and usage](#setup-and-usage), üîë [Security claims](#security-claims), and ‚ò†Ô∏è [Security limitations](#security-limitations)
- Developers should also read about ‚úçÔ∏è [testing](#testing) and üì¶ [Production](#production-builds)

## Setup and usage

- [Fork this repository][FORK_THIS] and add [GitHub Pages](../../settings/pages) via GitHub Actions.
- Just before setup + installation, [open an issue](../../issues) on your fork.

### Register your App

Follow these instructions at your new GitHub Pages site.

1. Click the link to create a GitHub App.
2. Copy an "app code" to the body of your new issue.
3. Click to add the GitHub app to your fork.
4. üîë Choose a secure master password.

You will be shown a new login link.

- üíæ Bookmark or save the login link.
- ‚úèÔ∏è  Memorize your master password.

## Security claims

During installation, your workflow makes public an [OPRF-derived][OPRF] key. You also reveal your [OPRF-derived][OPRF] installation key. **After this key exchange**, all public messages between you and your workflows are encrypted with [a shared secret][PAKE].
After creating and installing your app, each login takes ‚âà30 seconds to complete the password-authenticated [key exchange][PAKE] by:

- Authenticating your password against [OPRF key][OPRF] known only to your workflow.
- Returning a temporary session [AES-GCM][GCM] key for authenticated encryption.

After login, all reading/writing to your passwords:

- Are protected with an [Argon2][Argon2] hash unkwnown to your workflows.
- Are encrypted for your workflows with your single-session [shared secret][PAKE].

## Security limitations

To **edit or delete** you passwords, 
- You need your master password
- **AND** your personal login link

**Immediately** reset your master password if you reveal your password AND your login link. 
**Don't give others write access to your fork**:

- ‚ö†Ô∏è Don't add [collaborators][HELP_COLLAB] to your fork
- ‚ò†Ô∏è Don't let your GitHub account [be compromised][HELP_SECURE]

If they have write access to your fork, they can **erase** your data.

## Testing

### Remotely

When re-running installation workflow, first:

- Delete [your old app](https://github.com/settings/apps)
- Delete [the old environment](../../settings/environments)
- Ensure [latest release](../../releases/latest) body is empty
- Open or reopen an empty-bodied [issue](../../issues)
- Then navigate to your Pages site

### Locally

- In [environment.csv](./docs/environment.csv), set `REMOTE` to `your_username/public-quiz-device`.
- Open a terminal, and clone your forked repository:

```properties
YOU=your_username
REPO_URL=$YOU/public-quiz-device
git clone git@github.com:$REPO_URL.git
cd public-quiz-device
```

Install `pnpm`, `node 18`, and dependencies:

```properties
wget -qO- https://get.pnpm.io/install.sh | sh -
pnpm env use --global 18
pnpm install -g node-gyp
CXX=gcc pnpm install
```

In a separate terminal, run:

```properties
cd public-quiz-device
npx http-server docs -p 8000
```

Run `bash develop.bash` twice or more, following instructions.

### On 1st run, it registers your master password
  - You create and authorize a GitHub App to use GitHub's API.
  - It writes authentication codes to `.env` and a new login link.

### Afterwards, it allows revisiting your login link
  - If you want to make a new login link, press `n` after running.
  - To use your existing login link, press `y` after running.

## Production builds

Update the version in `package.json` and with a tag:

```properties
git tag v5.x.y
git push origin main --tags
```

On each pushed tag, the `build` workflow will:

- Create a pull request for compiled (`tsc`) packaged (`pkg`) linux executable
- Upload the `docs` directory to GitHub Pages.
